# DeepInfra-Wrapper Addon - Translation

This addon is used to translate OpenAI model names to the actual model names. The names are semi-random.

## Usage

To use this addon, you can call the `translate` function with a model name as the input. The function will return the corresponding actual model name.
Remember, you need to have `use_addons` set to `true` in the config.json
